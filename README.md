# Hey Day Script

Hello! This simple bash script was written in honor of Auburn University's Hey Day.
For more information about this event check out the University's [website](http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/).
This little script will ask for your name and return a salutation. 

## Running the script
To run the command use a UNIX command line, or bash interpreter, and run 

```sh
./hey-day.sh
```

If the program doesn't appear to be running you may need to give it permissions to execute in which case you will use 

```sh 
chmod +x hey-day.sh
```

Once the program has permission to execute you should be able to use the above code to run it. 


Enjoy!
